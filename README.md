# Be Life Premium Home Care

Marketing site for Be Life Premium Home Care — nursing, elderly, and
post-surgery care delivered at home across India and the Gulf.

Built with Next.js (App Router), React 19, and TypeScript. No UI framework or
CSS library — the styling is hand-written CSS transcribed from the approved
design.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in the real phone numbers
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

Requires Node 20.9+ (see `.nvmrc`).

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Development server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm start` | Serve the production build |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (`next/core-web-vitals` + `next/typescript`) |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |

## Project structure

│   └── icons.tsx
└── lib/
    ├── site.ts         # Phone / WhatsApp / email
    └── services.tsx    # Service cards, assurances, dropdown options
```

Everything except `EnquiryForm` renders on the server. The page is fully static
(prerendered at build time).

## Configuration

Contact details live in `src/lib/site.ts` and read from the environment:

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PHONE_NUMBER` | `+91 90000 00000` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` | falls back to the phone number |

These drive the header call button, the hero WhatsApp link, the footer, and the
floating consultation dock. The email address is set directly in `site.ts`.

## Styling

`src/app/globals.css` holds the design tokens:

| Token | Value | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--ink` | `#0f3a45` | Body text, dark buttons |
| `--teal` | `#12454f` | Hero and enquiry gradients |
| `--teal-darkest` | `#0a2830` | Footer |
| `--gold` | `#c1954c` | Primary CTAs, accents |
| `--gold-light` | `#d9b877` | Headings on dark, hover states |
| `--cream` | `#faf7f1` | Page background, cards on dark |
| `--cream-text` | `#f7f2e9` | Text on dark sections |

Breakpoints are 1024px, 900px, and 620px. A `prefers-reduced-motion` block
disables the float and fade-up animations.

### Mobile layout

The phone layout is tuned for scroll length — it went from 8383px to 4941px:

- **Services** render 2-up in a compact card below 620px rather than eight
  stacked full-size cards. The card itself is the link, so the "Learn more"
  affordance is hidden at that size.
- **Care in action** turns into a full-bleed horizontal snap rail below 900px.
  Four stacked squares cost ~1500px of scroll; one peeking row costs ~330px.
  It is focusable so it can be scrolled by keyboard.
- **Footer** keeps Services and Company paired side by side; only the brand and
  contact blocks span full width.
- **Hero CTAs** go full width for larger tap targets and a clean edge.

### Logo files

`public/be-life-logo.png` is cropped to the mark (the original had ~25%
transparent padding, so it rendered a quarter smaller than its CSS box).
`public/be-life-logo-reverse.png` recolours the teal half to cream for the dark
footer, where the standard mark is close to invisible.

## Deployment

Deploys as-is to any Next.js host. On Vercel: import the repo, set the two
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables, and deploy — no other configuration needed.

## Images

Photography lives in `public/images/`, named after its subject. Sources were
converted from ~2 MB PNGs to quality-82 JPEG (10 MB → 1.4 MB total); `next/image`
serves resized WebP/AVIF variants at request time.

| File | Used in |
| --- | --- |
| `hero-caregiver-with-elderly-woman.jpg` | Hero (4:5, `priority`) |
| `nursing-care-blood-pressure-check.jpg` | Care in action |
| `patient-care-bedside-support.jpg` | Care in action |
| `physiotherapy-home-session.jpg` | Care in action |
| `baby-care-newborn-nanny.jpg` | Care in action |

> **Three images carry another company's branding** and should be regenerated
> before launch — see Known gaps.

## Known gaps

- **Third-party branding in photography** — the generated images contain visible
  marks belonging to other businesses: `nursing-care-blood-pressure-check.jpg`
  shows "EliteCare" on the lanyard, ID badge and BP cuff;
  `baby-care-newborn-nanny.jpg` has "akshaya" embroidered on the uniform; and
  `physiotherapy-home-session.jpg` carries a "Move Better Feel Better" wall
  poster and uniform print. Regenerate these without text, or retouch, before the
  site goes live. The hero and `patient-care-bedside-support.jpg` are clean.
- **Enquiry form does not send** — it shows the confirmation state optimistically
  and discards the submission. See the `TODO` in `src/components/EnquiryForm.tsx`;
  this needs wiring to an inbox or CRM before launch.
- **Placeholder links** — footer About/Careers/Gallery/FAQ and the Privacy and
  Terms links point at `#`.
